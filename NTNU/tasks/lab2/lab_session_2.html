    <p>I have not learned <a href="#CSS" title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</a> yet, I use <a href="#HTML"title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</a> elements to display my contents in bold or italic.</p>
    <p>I hope to enjoy this subject, <span class=italic>IDG<sub>1292</sub></span>. I would like to emphasise that, by the end of this course, I want to <strong>master</strong> <span class="dotted"title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</span> & <span class="dotted" title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</span></p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am the youngest child of my house. Due to my condition, I have learned to use my wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice I have to face all the time.</p>
    <p>I have had a very tough life. My father despites me. Many people tried to murder me during my whole life. Among them, my sister, after being falsely accused of poisoning my nephew. I was lucky then, and my brother saved me. Since then, I have lived in exile and now I serve the enemy of my house.</p>
    <p>You may remember what I said at my trial, when I was falsely accused of killing my nephew, the King: <q>I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime: I'm guilty of being a dwarf!</q></p>
