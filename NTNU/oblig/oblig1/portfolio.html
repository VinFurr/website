        <p class="center">One of my works that i am most proud of was during the high school where i was
          building electrical installations. It was a lot of fun and i learned a lot about
          electrical & electronical systems, security systems and more!</p>

          <h3 class="portfolio_head_color center" id="el1">Electrical installation</h3>
          <p>My 1<sup>st</sup> part in this topic is about general electrical installation.
          During high schol where i studied electro, i have learned a lot of electic installations and systems.
          My primarily job was to plan, draw and build the system/installation and perform a final check.
          I was one of the best in my class and the systems i buildt rarely needed troubleshoot as they
          worked perfectly most of the time. In this video, you will see one of the most complex system i built.
          The two light bulb in the bottom is supposed to simulate heat cables, the light bulb in the middle is
          being controlled by two different switches and the the left and right light bulb is controlled by one
          double switch. The power output in both sides is also being active all the time no matter what position
          the switches is set to.</p>

          <h3 class="portfolio_head_color center" id="el2">Alarm system</h3>
          <p>Here is a small security system installation i built on my own.
          In this system, there are typical components thhat is also used in
          the real world such as alarm terminal, alarm central, IR detectors and magnetic contacts.
          Unfortunately, i did not install a the glass break detector because there were no glass
          to install it on. Connecting the detectors to the alarm central was surprisingly easy
          and i made sure that the alarm central would detect which sone the problem occured based
          on the different detectores connected to the different ports.</p>

          <h3 class="portfolio_head_color center">Im a chef!</h3>
          <p>Yes, thats true. I have been in a chef school where i learned to cook & fry food.
          The most important in a kitchen is to keep the equipment clean and never have meat
          and vegetables in the same cutting board. There are various food that i have made
          like Sheperd's Pie, Spring Rolls and Crème brûlée just to mention a few examples.
          Sadly i had to quit after the first year due to unexpected circumstances.</p>

          <p>Since i am a web developer student, i am of course experienced with web development.
            I actually started to have a little fun with coding before I even started the study.
            <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
            has been a big part of my study program, <em>IDG<sub>1292</sub> Web Coding</em>, and i have made several websited in that time.
