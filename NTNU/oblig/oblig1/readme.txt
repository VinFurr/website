-i had a few ideas for ading content, but some codes are not being used. 
-i used <!-- --> to "hide" the code instead of deleting it just in case if i wanted new changes that would make these codes useful.
-the navigation bar and footer codes is the same for all four pages
-the first part of every page follows the same pattern. all of the div's with the top_container class
-i am unexperienced with css optimilization so it is a lot of mess...
-was struggeling to think about how i would use all of the different tags, but i think i should have included the needed tags such as figure, sub/sup and strong/em as three examples 
-thought the boxes was necessary too so i added 3 of them in index.html under hobbies & interests
-the text color in all pages are different. all head tags (with one exception + navbar and footer in each page) has a darker text color than the text in paragraphs
-i could have copied an iframe from google maps, but it included javascript which i was not supposed to use
