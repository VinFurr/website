            <h2>Game descrption</h2>
            <p>Played with 4 or more different groups of 3-6 people. Save the food, don't waste it! Your goal is to save the food in your home. Each group starts with 100 points and will lose
            10 points each time a group member or group member's family throw edible food or losing 5 points for letting the food be spoiled. At the end of the week,
            tell your group how it went and how many points you have left. The group with the most remaining points left wins!</p>

            "The game is indeed not that good. And the fact that "you can die f starvation" could even be perceived as insensitive."

            <p>Play with a group of 5 or more. Your job is to survive the hunger pandemic for 5 turns.
            Toss a dice 3 times each turn. If the sum of the dices is 6 or lower, it means you have
            died of starvation and are out of the game and other players are not allowed to help you.
            Repeat for 5 turns. Who have died and who survived? Do you think that this is fair? Discuss!</p>
